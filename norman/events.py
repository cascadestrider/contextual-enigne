"""Tournament event calendar and active-window detection.

Phase 1 scope (Reddit-only): the calendar covers the four men's majors
plus a small set of PGA Tour signature events for 2026. active_event_window
returns the event whose [start - pre_days, end + post_days] window
contains a given date; event_query_combos generates 6-10 search queries
that cross event identifiers with Torque Optics pain-point anchors.

No score logic lives here — events are surfaced via the event_window
boolean on Lead, not via score modification.
